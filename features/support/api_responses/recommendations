They were able to get their new jobs from a combination of their enhanced resumes and their unique skills. You have unique skills too! This workshop is designed to assist the job seeker to create a brand new resume for the first time or for those who wish to update their resumes. Learn what the difference is between a \"functional\" and a\"chronological\" resume, what power verbs to use in your document, and how to format. It is highly recommended to bring a flash drive to save your work when you're done in your creation.\u00a0In addition this program will\u00a0allow the job seeker uninterrupted time for online job searching. Once your resume is complete, you can now use our internet service to do the actual search. We have books for you to borrow if you're not sure what career path to start with. For those who do know, you can visit company websites, or use Criagslist, fill out their applications, and attach your completed resume to send. Although there is no guarantee of landing a job, you'll have the resources the library has to offer. A completed resume and a flash drive\u00a0are required for your search. Be number 16! \u00a0 ",
